Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), and my current research focus is on safety, robustness and explainability of reinforcement learning systems. Besides, I am interested in causality, statistics and systematic investing. At Imperial, I am one of the organisers of the [Imperial College Autonomous Reasoning & Learning (ICARL) group](https://icarl.doc.ic.ac.uk/home), where we discuss all things reinforcement learning.

Prior to my doctorate studies, I spent 2.5 years as a data scientist at [causaLens](https://causalens.com/) -- that experience inspired me to do academic research on trusted AI systems. Also, I spent 1.5 years working as a quant in asset management in the Netherlands and in London.

I earned my MSc in Econometrics at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en) and BSc (Hons) at [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/), majoring in Mathematical Economics and minoring in Data Science & Machine Learning. 

I hold a UK Global Talent visa as an emerging leader in AI & ML. I have received multiple academic merit-based scholarships, including full funding for my PhD project and the Holland Scholarship for excellent students from outside of the EEA.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
