Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). My research is focused on improving robustness and generalisation in deep reinforcement learning. I am currently working on two questions:
1. *Policy-aware world models for AI safety evaluation*: Can we efficiently use knowledge about a deployment policy to learn a world model that would accurately predict safety of an agent’s behaviour?
2. *Safe neural policy updates in continual learning*: Can we update a neural policy to a new task while preserving its safety/robustness guarantees in prior tasks?

Besides, I am interested in ML and stats applications in quantitative finance. Currently, I am doing a PhD internship at [Cubist Systematic Strategies (Point72)](https://point72.com/cubist/) in London working on ML research for systematic global macro.

At Imperial, I am one of the organisers of the [Imperial College Autonomous Reasoning & Learning (ICARL)](https://icarl.doc.ic.ac.uk/home) group, helping manage research seminars and reading groups. I am also a part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Safe & Trusted AI](https://safeandtrustedai.org/).

Prior to my doctorate studies, I spent 2.5 years as a data scientist at [causaLens](https://causalens.com/) and worked as a quant in asset management in London and the Netherlands for 1.5 years. I earned my MSc in Econometrics at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en) and BSc (Hons) at [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/), majoring in Mathematical Economics and minoring in Data Science & Machine Learning. 

I hold a UK Global Talent visa as an emerging leader in AI & ML. I have received multiple academic merit-based scholarships, including full funding for my PhD and the Holland Scholarship for excellent incoming master's students from outside of the EEA.
