Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), and my current research focus is on safety, robustness and explainability of reinforcement learning systems. Besides, I am interested in causality, statistics and systematic investing. At Imperial, I am one of the organisers of the [Imperial College Autonomous Reasoning & Learning (ICARL)](https://icarl.doc.ic.ac.uk/home) group, where we discuss all things reinforcement learning.

Prior to my doctorate studies, I spent 2.5 years as a data scientist at [causaLens](https://causalens.com/) -- that experience inspired me to do academic research on trusted AI systems. Also, I spent 1.5 years working as a quant in asset management in the Netherlands and in London.

I earned my MSc in Econometrics at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en) and BSc (Hons) at [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/), majoring in Mathematical Economics and minoring in Data Science & Machine Learning. 

I hold a UK Global Talent visa as an emerging leader in AI & ML. I have received multiple academic merit-based scholarships, including full funding for my PhD project and the Holland Scholarship for excellent students from outside of the EEA.
